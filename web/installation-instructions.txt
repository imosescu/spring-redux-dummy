`Requirements`: NodeJs at least v8.10 and npm v3.5.2.

npm install lodash @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons react-redux redux redux-logger (is this needed the second time?)

npm install axios -> for HTTP requests


Probably just npm install is enough as the packages are already defined in package.json
